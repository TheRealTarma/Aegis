When you have a fish on the line, the bobber will dip, and you'll need to right-click it. Once the slider appears on your screen, right-click again when the arrow is in the green part of the meter to reel the fish in. %next%"

Higher tier axes become available at higher levels, and the better the axe, the better the wood you can chop. High-tier axes can even knock down a tree in one chop. %next%"

Increasing your cooking skill grants access to higher-tier foods that provide stronger benefits. For now, here's a basic recipe and the ingredients. Go ahead and right-click them on the cooking pot nearby."
