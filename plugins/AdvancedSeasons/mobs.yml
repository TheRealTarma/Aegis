# Is mobs spawning enabled?
enabled: true

# Chance for seasonal mobs to spawn
# Setting to 100 would double the number of mob spawns in the world
chance: 2

# This does not remove default mob spawns. This only spawns additional mobs to biomes
# To use MythicMobs, you need to append a line on the biome you want with the following format:
# mythicmob:<type>:hostile, the ":hostile" suffix is optional. If the mob is cataloged as "hostile", that means
# that it will spawn on low-light blocks.
