# This is a new feature used to automatically unlock
# new banks when a player has maxed the selected bank.
#
# The format is "the bank name:the command to run from console"
# Since the access to banks works with permissions, use
# your own permission plugin to make the player access the
# new bank, this action will be run as soon as the
# player upgrades the selected bank to the max level
# (In this example, when you max the "bank" bank it will run
# the "lp user %player% permission set bankplus.bank2" cmd):
# Auto-Banks-Unlocker:
# - "bank:lp user %player% permission set bankplus.bank2"
#
# You can also use more than 1 cmd:
# Auto-Banks-Unlocker
# - "bank:cmd1:cmd2:cmd3"

# To add more banks, go to the "banks" folder and
