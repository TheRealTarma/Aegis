  # Settings related to your currency
  currency:

    # The balance a new player will start with, and what "/economy reset <player>" will set the target player's balance to
    #      - TheosisEconomy does not support negative balances
    # Default: 0.00
    default-balance: 0.00

    # The maximum balance a player can have
    #      - Due to limitations of the Java "double" variable type, which Vault uses, this is limited depending on the number of decimal places you allow for your currency
    #      - The default value is 10 trillion, assuming you want to use 2 decimal places
    #      - If you want to use more than 2 decimal places, move the decimal point to the LEFT (e.g. for 4 decimal places, the max-balance value would become 100000000000.0000, which is 100 billion)
    #      - If you want to use less than 2 decimal places, move the decimal point to the RIGHT (e.g. for a whole number, you can just set the max-balance value to 1000000000000000, which is 1 quadrillion)
    #      - If you set the max-balance value to more than what the rules above allow, you will most likely experience precision loss, so I would strongly recommend not doing that
    # Default: 10000000000000.00
    max-balance: 10000000000000.00

    # The number of decimal places you want your currency to use
    # Default: 2
    decimal-places: 2

    # Your currency name (singular)
    # Default: "pound"
    name-singular: "Taro"

    # Your currency name (plural)
    # Default: "pounds"
    name-plural: "taros"

    # The format in which your currency will be displayed
    #      - <amount> will be replaced with the amount of money
    #      - <name> will be replaced with your currency name
    # Default: "Â£<amount> <name>"
    format: ":taro: <amount>"

    # What type of rounding should occur when an amount of money uses more decimal places than what the currency is configured to use
    #      - Valid values are NONE, ROUND_NEAREST, ROUND_UP, and ROUND_DOWN
    #      - If set to NONE, no rounding will occur, and the amount will not be accepted
